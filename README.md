# rEFInd-RetroGame Theme

An old-school retro Theme for rEFInd Bootloader. rEFInd-RetroGame is a theme inspired by the golden yesteryears of Gaming when pixelated graphics and tiny sprites were the norm. There was something beautiful about the design of those games; the colour schemes, the story lines, the illustraions, etc. rEFInd-RetroGame has tried to encapsulate the same artistic brilliancy and nostalgia to help rEFInd users to relive the past. This theme has tried to come up with an amazing blend by trying to combine Artworks of Retro Games with the Modern Minimalist Icon Design patterns. 

Efforts have been made to include icons that go well with this theme, all while staying true to the core philosphy behind the making of this theme. Icons for all major and some minor Operating Systems, be it the top Linux Distros or BSD distribution, have been included in this theme to ensure smooth usage of this theme for end users of rEFInd Bootloader.
